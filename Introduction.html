        <h1>Introduction to Subdivision Modelling</h1>
        <p>
          Subdivision modelling is one of those things that's very simple in
          principle but takes a little while to become accustomed to. If you
          don't think ahead you can paint yourself into a corner and need to
          backtrack to get your mesh to act the way you want it to.
        </p>

                alt="Comparison of cube with hard edges and a cube with rounded edges."
              />
              <figcaption>
                The rounded edges add significant depth compared to the sharp
                edges.

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          The entire basis of this modelling is this; in real life, almost no
          corners are infinitely sharp. There may be some instances of precision
          machined metal, or razor edges, but by and large everything has
          rounded edges. When you create a corner out of 2 flat polygons in a 3D
          renderer, the edge is infinitely sharp. The result of this is renders
          that look inherently unrealistic, and generally less interesting than
          the real thing. It's just impossible for unrealistically sharp edges
          like this to catch and reflect light the way that a real object would.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where subdivision modelling comes in. Subdividing a mesh is a
          method by which the mesh is algorithmically smoothed by creating more
          geometry following a specific set of rules that allows you to have a
          low polygon control mesh that is easy to edit, animate and store,
          while still being able to generate a consistent, smooth looking high
          polygon mesh for final rendering, or normal/AO map generation.
          Sculpted and decimated meshes are still the best option for organic
          meshes that require a lot of geometric detail, in a lot of cases a
          simple, subdivided mesh with advanced materials and shaders is a
          better use of both man and CPU time. Though Zbrush’s shadowbox and
          similar tools can be excellent for prototyping and blocking out shapes
          during the planning phase.

          The entire process of subdividing can be explained with these images,
          extrapolated into 3 dimensions and with multiple vertices and edges.
          It takes 2 adjacent lines (or surfaces in 3D), adds 2 vertices to the
          middle of those edges, and moves the original point to the averaged
          position of the new line, and the original point. This is by far the
          best way to control smoothly curved surfaces, with minimal geometry.

          There is a common misconception about subdivision modelling in that
          you can get around learning how the geometry works by simply creating
          a very high polygon control mesh, thus making the resulting
          subdivision mesh result in a very similar, slightly smoother mesh.
          This is a mistake and is the subject of a famous (in some circles at
          least) thread over on the Polycount forums that has been up for over
          10 years at the time of writing this and is over 150 pages long. This
          approach is technically possible in certain cases, but often you lose
          the advantages that come with having a simple, organized, low polygon
          control mesh.
        </p>

        <p>
          The real goal in subdivision modelling is to use the minimum amount of
          geometry to support the shapes you are trying to create, and no more.
          This keeps your meshes easy to work with, and actually maximize the
          smoothness of the surfaces. Think about it like this: is it easier to
          keep a smooth consistent curve when you must modify 10 points, or 3
          points?
        </p>
        <p>Okay, let's get into some basic rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>8 edges is the minimum number for an actually circular curve.</li>
          <li>
            Use the minimum amount of geometry you need to support the curves
            you're trying to create, no more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Work on your model at the viewing distance it is intended to be
            viewed from.
          </li>
          <li>Keep the polygons as regular in size and shape as possible.</li>
          <li>
            Take advantage of flat(true) surfaces to clean up or terminate
            edges.
          </li>
          <li>
            n-gons aren't that bad, and can be useful at junction and
            termination points.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s elaborate on these with some rules:</p>
        <div class="entry align-right">
          <a href="images/introduction-3.jpg" target="_blank">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="images/introduction-3.jpg"
                alt="Example a 4, and an 8 sided hole through a cube after subdivision. The 4 sided hole is not circular, but at a distance it becomes hard to tell."
              />
              <figcaption>
                The 8 sided hole on the left is circular, but the 4 sided hole
                on the right can pass depending on the application.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          It’s obvious in the model on the left that the 4-sided hole does not
          turn into a perfectly circular hole, but at a certain distance it
          becomes trivial and not worth adding the extra geometry to support the
          perfectly circular version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often, especially with normal map generation an edge as sharp as the
          real thing will not read as well when rendered out. When the edge
          becomes less than 1 pixel it will begin to alias as though there were
          no curve and you run into the problem we were trying to solve in the
          first place. So take into account the distance and resolution at which
          an object is intended to be viewed, and harden the edges according to
          your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, you can make any surface do exactly what you want with enough
          geometry. But they you’re just doing the work that you could be
          leaving to the subdivided geometry or should be using a sculpting
          program. You do need to plan your meshes so that you can have
          supporting edges in the right places when you need them, but a little
          planning can go a long way when you have to modify the model later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making a curved surface, sometimes you may have polygons in less
          than ideal distributions, but you must distribute them as evenly as
          possible or you will run into pinching or hard lines in the surface no
          matter how well you try to make the control mesh follow the curve, and
          again, you’re fighting with what the subdivision wants to do, which is
          to smooth everything out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flat surfaces with at least one supporting edge are essentially
          unaffected by subdivision. Even n-gons (polygons with more than 4
          sides) can be dealt with provided they’re on a flat surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have an area of leftover supporting edges, flat surfaces are
          a great place to terminate them so that one supporting edge doesn’t
          have to cut through the entire rest of the model for no reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now you should have a basic handle on subdivision modelling and
          some rules to follow. There is no way around practicing this style of
          modelling though, and you’ll never be able to intuitively grasp the
          way the geometry will react to subdivisions without many hours of work
          getting your hands dirty trying to model joining cylinders and
          surfaces. Try out some of our helpful

              <h2>Capping a cylinder with only quads</h2>
              <p>
                Typically a cylinder or any rounded surface is going to be
                capped with a single vertex in the center creating a triangle
                with each exterior edge of the circle. Provided the end is going
                to remain flat, and you are not planning on sculpting the mesh,
                this can be resolved by simply adding 2 supporting edges and the
                resulting pinching will be hidden by the flat top.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you inevitably end up in a situation where you need to
                actually do anything with the geometry at the end of a cylinder,
                like having it nicely rounded, or need it to subdivide evenly to
                use in a sculpting application, you will likely want it capped
                with a regular mesh of quads instead of the default pie slices.
              </p>
              <p>
                This process is very simple, and easy to do in any modelling
                application. Simply take the number of edges the cylinder is
                made of, and create a flat plane with the same number of
                exterior edges. Ideally this is a square number (24 edges would
                need a 6x6 plane, 36 edges would require 9x9). Sometimes you
                will have a stranger number, but as long as your cylinder
                geometry is consistent, and has an even number of edges you can
                use use any dimension of plane so long as the number of edges
                line up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then all you need to do is bridge the edges so that they line up
                in the neatest way possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                To add a finishing touch and distribute the geometry a little
                nicer you can smooth out the vertecies from the top plane (The
                <em>relax modifier</em> in 3ds Max, most 3d applicaions have a
                similar function). And now you can impress your friends with how
                cleanly you terminate your cylinders.

            <h2>Improve the speed and accuracy of your work</h2>
            <p>
              A very large amount of time in subdivision modelling is spent
              joining vertecies together to clean up the shapes and edges cut
              into a mesh. One of the ways you can improve your ability at this
              is to drill yourself on cleaning up messy meshes as a routine
              exercise to improve your speed over time. This also helps when you
              make changes, or add new tools to your workflow, to actually see
              the change or improvements over time. For example, it can be
              difficult to adopt a new hotkey (or sequence of hotkeys) even if
              you know it will make you work faster once you become used to it.
              Dedicated practice gives you an opportunity to learn new skills or
              workflows outside of interfering with actual projects you're
              working on
            </p>
            <p>
              One such practice drill that was popularised by Grant Warwick
              (Sathe on the 3D Total forums. His Hard Surface Essentials videos
              are still freely available on Vimeo, and are likely the best
              primers on the subject that exists) Who supposedly did this almost
              every day for 2 years when he was getting started. Is to take a
              simple shape, or flat plane, and just cut random lines and shapes
              into it for a couple of seconds, or a minute to give you a messy
              mesh to begin with. Then all you need to do is use the
              <em>target weld</em> tool to clean up the mesh with an emphasis on
              trying to be as accurate as possible, not wasting mouse clicks or
              movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can even save the initial messy mesh, and re-use it every time
              you do this, and if you time yourself you can objectively track
              your improvements over time.
